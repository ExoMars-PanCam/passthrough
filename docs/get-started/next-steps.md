# Next steps
!!! warning ""
    Please note that we're in the process of transitioning our documentation into this
    new format. We hope to have it completed by mid-May 2021; until then, some sections
    will be a little rough around the edges.

The [how-to area][1] contains a collection of to-the-point guides on how to accomplish 
various template and processing goals with PT. 

Keen to understand the details of the Python API or the PTL XML markup? Head over to the
[reference area][2] to learn more.

To understand what exactly happens in PT's pre- and post-processing steps, there is a 
page that goes into some detail over in the [background area][3]. In time this area of
the documentation will expand on the design decisions and rationale behind Passthrough.
