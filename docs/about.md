# About

## Project status
While major changes to the language specification are not foreseen, the template 
handler API and list of common extension functions are not yet stable. Additionally, 
the unit tests and CI setup need some love before Passthrough can be recommended 
for mission critical applications.

## Getting involved
Feedback and contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated - see 
the [GitHub repository][1] to learn more about how to get involved.

## Acknowledgements
Passthrough is developed by Ariel Ladegaard at Aberystwyth University, in support of the
ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars 2022 mission's PanCam instrument. This work has been funded by the 
UK Space Agency, grant numbers ST/T000058/1 and ST/V002686/1.

Special thanks are owed to Barry Whiteside (MSSL) and Komyo Furuya (JR) for offering 
comments and feedback as early adopters of Passthrough.

The project documentation has been written following Daniele Procidaâ€™s excellent
